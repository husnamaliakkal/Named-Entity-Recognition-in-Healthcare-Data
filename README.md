# Named Entity Recognition (NER) in Healthcare

## Project Overview
A health tech company called ‘BeHealthy’ aims to connect the medical communities with millions of patients across the country. ‘BeHealthy’ has a web platform that allows doctors to list their services and manage patient interactions and provides services for patients such as booking interactions with doctors and ordering medicines online. Here, doctors can easily organize appointments, track past medical records, and provide e-prescriptions.

The project aims to understand the application of NER in healthcare. Given a dataset containing medical text, the goal is to build an algorithm to map diseases and their respective treatments. 

## Example
Consider the following snippet of medical data:
“The patient was a 62-year-old man with squamous cell lung cancer, which was first successfully treated by a combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy.”

In this text, a person with a non-medical background may not understand the various medical terms. However, using NER, we can identify the disease name (squamous cell lung cancer) and its probable treatment (radiation therapy and chemotherapy).

## Methodology
- **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the medical text data.
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Use NER to identify disease names and their probable treatments.
- **Mapping Diseases and Treatments**: Build an algorithm to map diseases and their respective treatments based on the identified entities.

## Conclusion
Understanding the application of NER in healthcare can help in extracting valuable information from medical text, such as identifying diseases and their treatments. This project demonstrates the potential of NER in improving medical data analysis and healthcare services.
